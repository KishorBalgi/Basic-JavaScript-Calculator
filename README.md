# Basic-JavaScript-Calculator

Hi, This is a basic JavaScript calculator. Interface built using HTML 5, CSS 3.

HTML 5: Used to build the basic structure of the site.

CSS 3: used to style the HTML contents and add animations.

CSS Grid: used to align calculator buttons in row and column format.

JavaScript: Used to build the backend program for calculations and display results.

As this is project is among my first few projects, I was not able to build delete function.
